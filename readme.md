Here's how you can incorporate the documentation and GitHub Copilot usage for the `add_task` method into your `README.md` file:

# Task Management System

This is a simple task management system implemented in Python. It allows users to add, list, mark as complete, and delete tasks. The tasks are managed in memory and can be filtered by their completion status.

## Project Structure

```
requirements.txt
src/
    __init__.py
    controllers/
        task_manager.py
    main.py
    models/
        task_model.py
tests/
    test_task_management.py
    test_task.py
```

## Requirements

The project dependencies are listed in the `requirements.txt` file. To install them, run:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

To run the main script and see the task management system in action, execute:

```sh
python src/main.py
```

## Project Modules

### `src/main.py`

This is the main script that demonstrates how to use the `TaskManager` class. It includes functions to add tasks, mark them as complete, list tasks, and delete tasks.

### `src/models/task_model.py`

This module defines the `Task` class, which represents a task with attributes such as description, due date, and completion status.

### `src/controllers/task_manager.py`

This module defines the `TaskManager` class, which provides methods to manage tasks, including adding, listing, marking as complete, and deleting tasks.

## Example: `add_task` Method

The `add_task` method is used to add a new task to the task manager. It handles the creation of a task and raises a `ValueError` if the due date is not in the correct format.

### Method Documentation:

```python
def add_task(self, description, due_date):
    """
    Adds a new task to the task manager.

    Args:
        description (str): A brief description of the task.
        due_date (str): The due date for the task in YYYY-MM-DD format.

    Returns:
        Task: The newly added task.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If description or due_date is invalid (handled by the Task class).

    Example:
        To add a new task:
        ```python
        task_manager = TaskManager()
        new_task = task_manager.add_task("Finish Homework", "2025-01-15")
        print(new_task)
        ```

        If the due date is in an invalid format, a ValueError will be raised:
        ```python
        task_manager.add_task("Finish Homework", "15-01-2025")  # Raises ValueError
        ```

    GitHub Copilot's Contribution:
        - GitHub Copilot assisted in generating the structure of the method, including handling errors and raising exceptions.
        - It suggested the try-except block for catching specific errors related to invalid task attributes.
        - The usage example was generated by Copilot to help understand how to add a task and handle errors in real-world scenarios.
    """
    try:
        task = Task(description, due_date)
        self.tasks.append(task)
        return task
    except ValueError as e:
        # Handle specific errors related to invalid task attributes
        print(f"Error adding task: {e}")
        raise  # Re-raise the exception for further handling
```

## Tests

The project includes unit tests for the `Task` and `TaskManager` classes. The tests are located in the `tests` directory.

To run the tests, use:

```sh
python -m unittest discover tests
```

### `tests/test_task.py`

This test suite includes tests for the `Task` class, verifying task creation, handling invalid input, and the string representation of tasks.

### `tests/test_task_management.py`

This test suite includes tests for the `TaskManager` class, covering adding tasks, marking tasks as complete, listing tasks, and deleting tasks.

## GitHub Copilot Usage

This project was developed with the assistance of GitHub Copilot, an AI-powered code completion tool. GitHub Copilot helped in:

- Generating boilerplate code for classes and functions.
- Providing suggestions for error handling and input validation.
- Writing unit tests for the project modules.
- Improving code readability and consistency.
- Documenting the code

The example for the `add_task` method and its error handling was generated by GitHub Copilot, demonstrating how AI can assist in building structured documentation and functional code snippets.
